# What is Cheerp?

Cheerp is a C++ compiler for the Web, based and integrated into the LLVM/clang infrastructure.

With Cheerp you can write Web applications in pure C++ code, or port existing C++ code to the Web. Your C++ code is fully optimized by the LLVM system and it's compiled into JavaScript code that runs on the browser.
